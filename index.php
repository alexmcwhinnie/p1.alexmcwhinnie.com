		<h3>Bio</h3>
		<p>Tropical by birth, but a New Englander by choice. After traveling the world, I immigrated from Sydney, Australia to one of the coldest places in America. I take advantage of the short, but amazing summers, by gardening and <a href="http://sailing.mit.edu">sailing at MIT</a>, and I pass the time in winter skiing and complaining about the cold.</p>
		<h3>Code Editor</h3>
		<p>Sublime Text 2 & Adobe Dreamweaver</p>
